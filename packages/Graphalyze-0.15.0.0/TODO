TODO for Graphalyze
===================

* Report framework
    * Extend the report framework
    * Explore options for generating multiple files
    * Differentiate between "large" and "small" images
    * The pandoc code (especially elements) is a bit of a mess... can it be cleaned up?

* Analysis stuff
    * Default graph -> alg -> report element stuff

* Write a README

* For Reporting, have a Document -> IO Document function that
  generates all the visualisations and replaces all GraphImage
  DocElement values with DocImage, etc. (and then the Document ->
  Pandoc conversion can be pure).
